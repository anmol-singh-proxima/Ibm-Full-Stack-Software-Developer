- Distributed Version Control System
    - A Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) keeps track of changes to code, regardless of where it is stored. This allows multiple users to work on the same codebase or repository, mirroring the codebase on their own computers if needed, while the distributed version control software helps manage synchronization amongst the various codebase mirrors.

- Repositories are storage structures that:
    - Store the code
    - Track issues and changes
    - Enable you to collaborate with others

- Git is one of the most popular distributed version control systems.
- Web Hosted Services for Git Repositories:
    - GitHub
    - GitLab
    - Bitbucket
    - beanstalk
