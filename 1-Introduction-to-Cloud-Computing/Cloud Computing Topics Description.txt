=====================================
======== CLOUD INFRASTRUCURE ========
=====================================


Cloud Infrastructure:
- Cloud infrastructure consists of data centers, storage, networking components, and compute resources
- Physical resources are housed in Regions, Availability Zones (AZ) and Data Centers
- Region consist of more than three AZ
- AZ consist of one or more Data Centers
- These AZs are isolated from each other in a Region having their own power, cooling, networking resources
- Isolation of AZs improves the cloud's fault tolerance, decrease latency, and more
- These AZs are connected with other AZs, Data Centers and the internet through a very high bandwidth
- Data Centers contains Pods, Rocks, Server, Storage, and Networking Equipments
- Computing Resources:
    - Virtual Servers or VMs (Software based)
    - Bare-Metal Servers (Physical Servers)
    - Serverless (Abstraction on VMs)
- Storage Options
    - Block Storage
    - File Storage
    - Object Storage
- Networking
    - Contains physical networking hardware like Routers, Switches.
    - Several Networking resources are virtualised and made available as services and called as SDN(Software Define Network)
    - Networking interfaces needs:
        - IP Addresses
        - Subnets
        - Security Group
        - ACL (Access Control Lists)
        - VLAN (Virtual LAN)
        - VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
        - VPN (Virtual Private Network)
    - Resources are virtualised and made available as services:
        - Firewalls
        - Load Balancers
        - Gateways
        - Traffic Analyzers
    - Other Networking capability:
        - CDN (Content Delivery Network)


Virtualization:
- Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based version of physical resources, made possible through the use of hypervisors
- There are 3 components in Virtualization:
    - Host - The infrastructure which contains the physical resources like CPU, memory, processor, etc
    - Hypervisor
        - The piece of software which enables the process of virtualization on the Host
        - It manages the physical resources allocated to the VMs
    - Virtual Machine
        - It is the software which runs on Hypervisor and acts like a virtual server
        - It is an independent entity in itself supporting all the features for hosting an OS
        - It can be transfered from one physical server(Host) to another very easy and quickly in case if any physical server goes down
- There are 2 kinds of Hypervisor
    - Type 1 - This directly runs on the Host (physical server) and aka Bare-Metal Servers
    - Type 2 - This runs on the OS (Host OS) hosted on the Host
- Benfits:
    - Cost Savings
    - Agility and Speed
    - Lower Downtime


Virtual Machines (VMs):
- These are also known as Virtual Servers, Virtual Instances or Instances
- User can choose the configurations such as:
    - Region and Zone
    - Operating System
    - Multi-Tenant or Single-Tenant
    - Billing - Monthly or Hourly
    - Storage and Networking options
- The different types of VMs are:
    - Shared or Public Cloud VMs
        - These are hosted on a Virtual Server and shared among other users
        - These are Multi-tenant VMs
        - Cloud provider provides pre-defined sizes and configurations
        - Pricing happens by hours or seconds, or sometimes Monthly
    - Transient or Spot VMs
        - These VMs take advantage of unused capacity in a cloud data center
        - These are lower in prices but possess the risk of loosing the data
        - These VMs can get de-provisioned at any time whenever the cloud infrastructure needs the resources back
        - These VMs are great for:
            - non-production work
            - testing and developing of applications
            - running stateless workloads
            - running big data at low cost
    - Reserved Virtual Instances
        - These reserve capacity and guarantee resources for future deployments
        - Reserving capacity terms are 1-year or 3-years making it cheaper
    - Dedicated Hosts
        - These are Single-tenant isolation VMs
        - These let the users make exclusive use of resources
        - Users need to specify data center and pod
        - These allows for maximum control over workload
        - Used for meeting compliance and regulatory requirements or lisencing terms


Bare-Metal Servers:
- A bare-metal server is a single-tenant, dedicated physical server
- Cloud provider manages the server upto the OS
- Customer is responsible for administering and managing everything else on the server
- Bare-metal Configurations:
    - Processors
    - RAM
    - Hard Drives
    - Specialised Components
    - OS
    - GPUs
- Customers can install their own OS and Hypervisor thus creating their own VMs

        - Low cost to use


Securing Network in Cloud:
- Securing netwoks in cloud from cyber threats is an important job
- Networking capabilities in the cloud are delivered as a service rather than in the form of rack-mounted devices
- Cloud Network:
    - creates logical instances of the networking elements
    - provides Networking functions as a Service
    - defines the size of the Network using IP address range
-  Cloud resources, such as VMs (or VSIs), storage, network connectivity, and load balancers, are deployed into subnets within Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).
- Cloud -> Regions -> Virtual Private Clouds -> Zones -> Subnets -> Instances
- Subnets has ACL which serve as Subnet-level Firewalls
- Instances has Security Group which serve as firewalls for them
- These Subnets can be Public and Private
- Other features in Cloud Network:
    - Public Gateway and VPN Gateway
    - Public and Private Load Balancers
- Building a Cloud Network entails creating a set of logical constructs that deliver networking functionality akin to data center networks for securing environments and ensuring high performing business applications


Containers:
- Containers are an executable unit of software in which application code is packaged, along with its libraries and dependencies, in common ways so that it can be run anywhere—desktops, traditional IT, or the cloud.
- These are small, fast and portable
- Process of Making a Container:
    - Create a container manifest consists of metadata related to container
    - Create an actual image of the application
    - Finally, create a container
- Characteristics:
    - They have an Host OS on physical server like VMs
    - They do not have Hypervisor, instead they have Runtime Engine (based on container provider)
    - On Runtime engine, the container contains some libraries along with the application code making it smaller in size in comparison to the VMs where each VM has an Host OS and binaries which increases the file size significantly
    - If we want to scale our application then we need to add more containers for the application, and since containers are smaller in size so they do not require much space
    - In VMs, the main issue is of the compatibility of the application code with the VM host-OS and binaries
- Containers are lighter weight and consume fewer resources than Virtual Machines - helping streamline the development and deployment of cloud native applications.



===============================
======== CLOUD STORAGE ========
===============================


Cloud Storage:
- Cloud Storage is where customers save their data and files in the cloud
- The data is accessible in two ways:
    - By attaching the data storage to a computer node
    - By accessing it on Public or dedicated Private network
- Cloud providers Host, Secure, Manage and Maintain the cloud storage to ensure the data access
- The storage also follows pay-per-use method
- IOPS - Input/Output Operations Per Second
- Snapshot
    - A point in time image of the storage
    - Fast to create
    - Don't require Downtime
    - Record only changes to data
    - Cannot recover individual files
- Direct Storage
    - It is also known as Local Storage
    - It is within the same server or rack
    - It is fast and generally used for hosting OS
    - It only lasts as long as the compute resource it attached to
    - It cannot be shared with other nodes
    - It is non-resilient to failures
- File Storage
    - There is storage which is connected to the computer nodes via an ethernet network
    - It is slower and lower cost
    - It can be mounted and used by multiple servers all at once
- Block Storage
    - These are provisioned as volumes and mounted on compute node using a high-fiber connection
    - It is very fast and suitable for Databases
    - These volumes are mounted to a single compute node at a time
    - Data is persist in Block Storage i.e. once the instance is deleted the data can stil be there
    - Snapshots can be created in Block Storage
- Object Storage
    - This storage is not attached to servers but is accessible via API
    - It is slowest in Speed
    - It is least expensive and infinite in size
    - It is suitable for all unstructured data types:
        - Documents
        - Videos
        - Logs
        - Backups
        - Data from IoT
        - App binaries
        - VM images


File Storage:
- Like Direct Attached Storage, File Storage needs to be attached to Compute Node to store data
- Unlike Direct Attached Storage, File Storage is:
    - Less Expensive
    - More Resilient to Failure
    - Less disk management and maintenance for user
    - Provision much larger amounts of storage
- File Storage offer storage in the form of disks or volumes to the Compute Node
- File Storage is mounted from remote storage appliances
    - Physical Disks -> Storage Appliances -> Compute Node
- Storage Appliances are:
    - Resilient to failure
    - Offer Encryption
    - Managed by service provider
- Ethernet Networks:
    - File Storage is mounted on Compute Nodes via Ethernet Networks
    - These Ethernet networks are dedicated to storage
    - Also known as Network Attached Storage or Network File Storage (NFS)
    - Speed may vary based on network traffic and it is not consistent so File Storage is used for workloads where consistent speed is not required
- Multiple Compute Nodes:
    - File Storage can be mounted onto more than one compute node
    - All the files can be shared among multiple compute nodes
    - Common Workloads:
        - Repository of files
        - Low cost Database storage
- Customer can specify IOPS specifications for File Storage


Block Storage:
- Block Storage breaks files into chunks (or blocks) of data
- It stores each block separately under a unique address
- It must be attached to a compute node before it can be utilized
- Features:
    - Mounted from remote storage appliances
    - Extremely resilient to failure
    - Data is more secure (Data Encryption at rest and in transit)
- It is mounted as a volume at compute nodes using a dedicated network of optical fibres:
    - Signals move at the speed of light
    - Higher price-point
    - Perfect for workloads that need low-latency
    - Provide consistent high speed
    - Suitable for Databases and mail servers
    - Not suitable for shared storage between multiple servers
- Customer can specify IOPS characteristics and adjust the IOPS as needed based on the requirements


Object Storage:
- Object Storage need not be connected to any compute node to use it
- It can be used with the help of API (Application Programming Interface)
- It is less expensive than other storage options
- Object Storage is effectively infinite
- In Object Storage, customer does not have to pay for a fix storage rather just the customer consume the storage that he/she require and pay for just that usage
- It is good for large amount of unstructured and static data
- Data Storage:
    - Data in object storage is not stored in any kind of hierarchical folder or directory structure
    - Data is stored as objects and these objects are stored in buckets
    - One bucket cannot be stored in another bucket
    - These buckets have a flat structure of data storage where all the objects are stored directly
    - These objects have some meta data to contain some details to:
        - Locate and access Object
        - The time that the object was stored or last accessed
    - These buckets have an infinite amount of size
- Some cloud provider provides 2 kinds of buckets:
    - Non Resilient
        - Data is only stored in one Data center
        - Used in situations where high availability is less of an issue
    - Resilient
        - Data is stored multiple times in different Data centers
        - Usually cost more but provide highest level of resilience and availability
- Data can be anything like:
    - Text files
    - Audio files
    - Video files
    - IoT Data
    - VM images
    - Backup files
    - Data Archives
- It is not suitable for operating systems, databases and data with changing Content


Object Storage - Data Tiers & APIs:
- Object Storage is divided into different Bucket categories called Tiers
- The tiers in Object Storage are:
    - Standard Tier - Store objects that are frequently used
    - Vault/Archive Tier - Store objects that are accessed once or twice a month
    - Cold Vault Tier - Store objects that are accessed one or twice a year
- Automatic Archiving Rule - The object will move to a cheaper storage tier if not accessed for long
- Object Storage - Speed:
    - Does not come with IOPS options
    - Slower than file or block storage
    - Data in Cold Vault can take hours for retrieval
- Object Storage is priced per GigaByte
- Application Programming Interface (API):
    - API helps in accessing the data from Object Storage without using the compute node
    - Many Object Storage providers have S3 compatible API
    - It is HTTP based RESTful API or webservers
- Object Storage - Backup Solutions:
    - Effective solution for backup and disaster recovery
    - Replacement for offsite backups
    - Many backup solutions come with built-in options for object storage in Cloud
    - More efficient than tape backups for geographical redundancy


Content Delivery Network (CDN):
- It is a Distributed Server Network that delivers temporary stored or cached copies of website content to the users
- Website is hosted on a server in one geographical location but CDN stores the website contents in the servers of different geographical locations that decreases the distance between the client and the website server
- Benefits:
    - Increase the speed of the website
    - Decrease the load on the website server
    - Increase the uptime of the server
    - Increases the security of the server

    - Composite Cloud
        - When an organisation make use of multi-cloud by distributing their delivery service application across multiple cloud environments and providers, spread across multiple geographies
        - The organisation can individually scale their different servers based on the loads on website in different regions
    - Modernize
        - Airline industry uses the on-premise server and their applications are mostly web-apps
        - When these organisations take their legacy on-premise application to a mobile application using cloud to increase their customer's experiences, they modernize
        - When they want to add a new recommendation feature for their customers to book new flights when the flight gets delayed, they do modernization
    - Data and AI
        - In Airline industry, around 30%, the flights gets delayed because of the unplanned maintenance happened in flights
        - These organisations can take tons of historical data and feed that data in ML and AI models to predict the happenings of unplanned maintenance
        - This way they can reduce the number of unplanned maintenance thus reducing the number of delays in flights
- Using Hybrid Multi Cloud, organisations can prevent lockin to one cloud provider and maintain their workload by dividing it among different cloud providers


Microservices:
- Microservices is an Architecture where a single application is composed of loosely coupled and independent deployable smaller components or services
- These services have their own stack running on their own containers
- They communicate with one another over a combination of:
    - APIs
    - Event Streaming
    - Message Brokers
- For Business, it means:
    - Multiple developers can work independently on different components of the application making it efficient and less-time consuming
    - They can use different stacks and runtime environments for different components thus reduce the dependency on one stack
    -  These components can independently scale instead of the scaling of the entire application thus reduce the cost
- Illustration:
    - In an application, the different components can be:
        - Search
        - Recommendations
        - Customer Ratings
        - Product Catalogue
    - These components can be developed individually by different teams of developers and then can work together to create a functioning application
    - These Microservices are distributed using Containers and these containers are plugged into application so if one container has an issue, it can be removed from the application and a new container can be plugged into the application to keep it running
    - Developers need not write code for these components from scratch thus the developement time is very less which helps in deploying a big application in a matter of days or weeks unlike previous days when they used to take months
    - Before these components can work together they first search each other by creating a roadmap for all the components, this process is called as Service Discovery
    - Then they communicate with each other by using API


Serverless Computing:
- Serverless Computing is an approach to computing that offloads the responsibility for common infrastructure management tasks such as
    - Scaling
    - Scheduling
    - Patching
    - Provisioning
    to the cloud providers, allowing developers to focus their time and effort on development and testing, and not have to worry about provisioning, maintaining and scaling compute resources.
- Serverless means the management of the underlying physical or virtual servers is removed from the users
- Serverless computing environment allocates the resource as needed for the application
- Attributes that distinguish Serverless Computing:
    - No provisioning of the servers and runtimes
    - Runs code on-demand and scaling as needed
    - Pay only when invoked and used i.e. not when underlying compute resources are idle
- Serverless:
    - Abstracts the infrastructure away from developers
    - Code executed as individual functions
    - No prior execution context is required
- Scenario:
    - There is a front-end and a database of the website
    - Front-end gets the text file from the user and database store the file
    - But between them, the text file needs to be translated before storing it into the database
    - There comes the serverless platform which can take the text file from front-end and do the translation and store it in database
    - Now, whenever a text file gets uploaded via front-end, the serverless platform will get invoked and perform the necessary operation
    - But the serverless platform will remain inactive in all other times
- Determing Fit with Serverless:
    - Evaluate application characteristics
    - Ensure that the application is aligned to serverless architecture patterns
- Application that qualify for a serverless architecture include:
    - Short-running stateless functions
    - Seasonal workloads
    - Production volumetric data
    - Event-based processing
    - Stateless Microservices
- Serverless architectures are well-suited for use cases around:
    - Data and Event processing
    - IoT
    - Microservices (most common)
    - Mobile backend
- Use Cases:
    - Serverless is well-suited to working with the following data:
        - Text
        - Audio
        - Image

        - Configuration management
    - Start up from zero to serve a new request


Cloud Native Applications:
- Cloud-native application are the applications:
    - New applications developed to work only in cloud environment
    - Existing application refactored and reconfigured with cloud native principles
- Cloud-native application is build out of several Microservices combined to work as a single application
- Development principles:
    - Microservice architecure approach - break down the application to single function Microservices
    - Rely on Containers - for maximum flexibility, scalibility and portability
    - Adopt Agile methods - speed up the process based on the improvement process though quick and iterative feedback from users
- Cloud Native Application Service-Architecture (from bottom to top):
    - Cloud infrastructure (Public/Private/Enterprise infrastructure, etc)
    - Scheduling and Orchestration (ex. kubernetes)
    - Application and Data Services
    - Application Runtime (traditionally called Middleware)
    - Application Code
- Benfits:
    - Enabling Innovation
    - Business Agility
    - Commoditization
- Any application can be cloud-native application and to leverage the cloud-native architecture, each application should have:
    - Standardised Logging
    - Standardised Events
    - Standardised Catalogue
- And need to leverage services core to the system like:
    - Load balancing
    - Service Discovery
    - Routing
- Cloud Native applications are Enterprise and Engineering at scale


DevOps on the Cloud:
- Development Teams need to Design, Develop, Deliver and Run Software
- Operations Teams need to provide solution to the problem by Monitoring, Predicting failure, Managing environments and Fixing issues.
- By combining the Development and Operations teams to monitor, analyse and fix the problems become DevOps

=============================================
======== CLOUD SECURITY & MONITORING ========
=============================================


Cloud Security:
- Shared Responsibility
    - For Security on Cloud, it is a shared responsibility between the customer and the cloud provider
    - Cloud Security is at all the three levels of services provided by the cloud:
        - IaaS
        - PaaS
        - SaaS
    - In all these three levels, the security is divided among customer and cloud provider based on the responsibility they have for managing the services
- Architecture
    - Security on Database level
        - Build Your Own Key (BTOK)
        - K Your Own Key (KYOK)
        - Encryption at-rest, in-motion and in-use
    - Security at Applcation Level
        - Application Scanning
        - Container Image Scanning
    - Security at User level
        - Identity (Authentication & Authorization)
        - Network (Network Access Control)
        - Prevention against DDOS and Web Attacks
        - Web (or application) Firewall
    - In order to protect the Data, you need to manage access
    - Continuous Security
        - Gain Insights to check for Posture, Compliance and Threats
        - Ability to gain visibility or Insights
        - Having insight to take the turn the Insights to actionable actions or Remmidiate
- DevOps
    - The process of DevOps needs to be secure so it becomes SecureDevOps
    - The process of DevOps is the following in loop:
        - Design -> Build -> Manage Security
    - So we need to apply security at each level i.e. Secure Design, Secure Build and so on.


Identity and Access Management (IAM):
- IAM is also known as Access Control
- It is the 'first line of defense' which allows 'authenticate and authorize users' and 'provide user-specific access'
- Cloud Security Concerns
    - Data Loss and Leakage
    - Unauthorized Access
    - Insecure interfaces and APIs
- Main Types of Users
    - Administrative Users
        - Administrators | Operators | Managers
        - Create, update and delete applications and instances
        - Also need insight into their team member's activities
    - Developer Users
        - Application developers | Platform developers | Application publishers
        - Read sensitive Information
        - Create, update and delete applications
    - Application Users
        - Normal user or Client
- Authentication & User Identity
    - IAM authenticates the user on application level based on the following Identity providers:
        - Cloud directory
        - Social login
        - Enterprise Identity provider
        - Cloud Identity provider
- Multifactor Authentication
    - Used to combat Identity theft by adding an additional level of authentication for application users:
    - These additional authentication levels are:
        - Single Use Password
        - Pins
        - Certificates
        - Tokens
        - Risk based
- Cloud Directory Services
    - Are used to securely manage user profiles and their associated credentials and password policy inside a cloud environment
    - Applications hosted on the cloud do not need to use their own user Repository
- Reporting
    - Reports helps provide a user-centric view of access to resources or a resource-centric view of access by users
    - They typically gives the following information:
        - which users can access which resources
        - changes in user access rights
        - access methods used by each user
- Audit and Compliance
    - It is a critical service within identity and access management framework, both for cloud provider and cloud consumer
    - Auditors validate implemented controls against:
        - Security policy
        - Industry compliance
        - Risk policies
        - Report deviations
- User and Service access management
    - Enables cloud application/service owners to provision and de-provision:
        - Customer profile
        - Partner profile
        - Vendor profile
    - Streamline access control based on:
        - Role
        - Organisation
        - Access policies
- Mitigating Risks
    - In order to mitigate the risks of these accounts being hacked into, you require maximum control over the whole life cycle of these users
    - Some of the controls are:
        - Provisioning users by specific roles on resources for each user
        - Password policies for password creation
        - Multifactor authentication
        - Immediate de-provisioning of access when users leave or change roles
- Access Groups
    - A group of users and service IDs created so that the same access can be assigned to all entities within the group with one or more access policies
    - Offered by most cloud providers:
        - Create Access Groups
        - Add users to Access Groups
        - Manage access for existing Groups
    - Benefits
        - Streamline access assignment process vs assigning individual user access
        - reduce number of policies
- Access Policies
    - Access policies defines how users, service IDs and access groups in the account are given permission to access account resources
    - Policies include:
        - Subject - which can be users, serice IDs or access groups
        - Target - which is the resource or service
        - Role - the resource to which the access is being granted

        - Sophisticated encryption
    - Console:
        - Define and manage access policies
        - Create, rotate and manage keys
        - Aggregate access logs
- Key Management
    - Encryption does not eliminate security risk
    - It separates the security risk from the data
    - Keys needs to be managed and protected against threats
    - Key Management services enable customers to
        - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
        - Easily create and manage the entire lifecycle of cryptographic keys
        - Protect data from cloud service providers
    - Best Practices:
        - Storing encryption keys form the encrypted data
        - Taking key backups offsite and auditing them regularly
        - Refreshing the keys periodically
        - Implementing multi-factor authentication for both the master and recovery keys
